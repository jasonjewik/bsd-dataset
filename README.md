# bsd-dataset

The Big Statistical Downscaling (BSD) Dataset.

## Downloading data with the BSD Package

WIP.

## Using a Custom Region

**Note:** Right now, the only available target dataset is CHIRPS, [which covers the Earth from 50 degrees north to 50 degrees south](https://wiki.chc.ucsb.edu/CHIRPS_FAQ#What_are_the_spatial_domain_available_for_CHIRPS.3F).

WIP.

## Running tests

```shell
bsd-dataset$ python -m pytest tests/
```

Note: `test_dataset.py` will take a while to run (a minute or so).
